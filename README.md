# ElaraAIAssistant ðŸ¤–âœ¨

**ElaraAIAssistant** is an open-source AI assistant built in Python. It utilizes speech recognition, text-to-speech, and machine learning to provide smart, voice-activated assistance. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and basic machine learning techniques to understand user commands and provide helpful responses.

This project is great for anyone looking to learn about voice recognition, machine learning, and building interactive AI systems.
